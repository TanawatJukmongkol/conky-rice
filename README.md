# conky-rice
my custom lua conky widget rice [Work in progress]
Note: I know there are some English typos, in the lua config file. It'll be fixed after I realased the full version.

# How to install:
  0. Install `conky, libcairo, libcairo-dev` (or the conky-all meta package on Debian based systems).
  1. Download the zip file using the green button with the label `code` (or clone it using git command).
  2. Move the file "conkyrc", and "conky" folder to your user's home, and rename it to ".conkyrc" and ".conky" respectively.
  3. Run conky (may need to change some fonts in the config file, if not displayed correctly).
